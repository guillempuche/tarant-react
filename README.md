# Tarant in React

This library allows using Tarant in React.

Under the hood is using the React Hook `useSyncExternalStore`. Documentation [here](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore). This library uses a backwards-compatible shim for [useSyncExternalStore by Meta](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/use-sync-external-store)

The core implementation comes from [Kevin Mas](https://www.github.com/kmruiz/).

Yarn:

<!-- - to work with the examples in IDE VScode, open each example folder on VSCode because of Yarn PnP needs to know where to look for TypeScript. -->
